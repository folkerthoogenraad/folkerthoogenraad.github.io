This is me, in the middle of Scotland near <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ZhDJRBtis5N2">Loch Tarff</a> with a gorgeous view on all sides. 
This ofcourse sounds very clich√© but this is one of my favourite moments of my life. I love sporting, and mountain walking (or maybe even climbing) 
is one of the best things in my opinion.

My whole life I've done speed skating. I am, after all, dutch. 

Whenever there is ice in nature I will go out and skate on it. Last year we did and my friend Justin documented it with his gopro, 
drone and camera. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHaH6RmP0BE">Check out the video here</a>.

In the summer speedskating is not possible, even in the Netherlands. So, I do other things, like sport cycling and <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline-skaten">inline-skating</a>

Since a few months I started bouldinging. I'm really enjoying the new challange. For those in the know, I climb around 5c+/6a.

<h1>Programming</h1>

<p>
From a young age I fell in love with computers. One of my friends introduced me to some simple programming on primary school. We tinkered around with
a game we found online (I can't find it anymore, sadly) and changed around some of the models and textures by editing the files. This was really something for me at the time. 
This inspired my life long interest in computer science. I ended up studying computer science at <a href="https://www.saxion.nl/">Saxion University</a> and graduated in 2018.
</p>
<p>
I love making games, or more specifically: game engines.

<h1>Music</h1>
<p>
I cannot imagine a life without music. I'm constantly listening to music, making music or composing music. 
I was always interested in playing the piano, However, I never wanted to get lessons until about two years ago. <a href="#music">Checkout some of my music!</a>
