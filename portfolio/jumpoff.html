<h1>Jump Off</h1>
<p>Jump Off is a mobile game I made for Android (not for iOS because I'm a poor student without access to a mac (through any legal means)). In this game you are 
a block falling down a well and you need to jump from wall to wall in order to survive as long as possible. Its action packed with short games, lasting about 1 minute each.
