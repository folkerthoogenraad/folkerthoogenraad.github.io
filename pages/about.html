                <h1>Software Engineering</h1>
                <p>I've been doing software engineering for quite a while now. 
                    I started way back when I was about 11 years old with a programming book and my moms laptop on a holiday 
                    and I haven't been able to quit since.
                    My specialties are:

                <h1>Music</h1>
                <p>I love music, whether it is listining to it, performing it or producting it. I play the piano, dabble on the guitar and play a little of the cajon. Checkout my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/justf-548447368/discotown">SoundCloud</a> for all my compositions and productions.</p>

                <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                <p>Most of my free time is taken up by the three things: Software engineering, music production and sport. I've always been a speedskater and performed on a high level in the dutch speedskating scene. 
                    I quit the high level skating scene when I started my bachlors degree. Now I do bouldering three times a week and still skate once a week.</p>
