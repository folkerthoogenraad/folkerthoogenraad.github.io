                <p>Ever since I was an eleven year old on his mom’s laptop, I’ve been making my own games. A book on programming, a few rainy days in England and an old office computer shaped the beginning of my passion. A passion that only grows every day.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    Since then, I’ve specialized in game development, web design and development, compliers and programming languages. I am fluent in C++ (11 and up mostly), C#, Java and Javascript (Typescript). I’m always just a few lines of code away from making anything I &mdash; or you &mdash; could want.
                </p>

                    Aside from code, I’m also fluent in music. Whether it’s listening, playing, composing or producing, I find time for music almost every day. 
                    What I also do as often as I can, is sports. I’ve done speedskating competatively since I was little and performed on a high level in the dutch speedskating scene. Because of my studies I no longer compete on the same level, but I’ve started training pupils and have started bouldering (rock climbing) three times a week, which I've been doing ever since.
